Inspired by spf13-vim, but not happy about the large bundle collection and lack of control in the package management/upgrade process, this is my personal attempt to tailor it to a version that works for me.

There are two types of changes: excluding packages that I don't use; use a passive update mechanism (based on pathogen).
