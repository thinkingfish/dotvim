Inspired by [spf13-vim](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim), but not happy about the large bundle collection and lack of control in the package management/upgrade process, this is my attempt to tailor it to my own need with minimum clutter and maximum control.

There are two types of changes: excluding packages that I don't use; use a passive update mechanism (based on pathogen).
